# SentenceTransformer based on sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2

This is a [sentence-transformers](https://www.SBERT.net) model finetuned from [sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2). It maps sentences & paragraphs to a 768-dimensional dense vector space and can be used for semantic textual similarity, semantic search, paraphrase mining, text classification, clustering, and more.

## Model Details

### Model Description
- **Model Type:** Sentence Transformer
- **Base model:** [sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2) <!-- at revision e8c3b32edf5434bc2275fc9bab85f82640a19130 -->
- **Maximum Sequence Length:** 384 tokens
- **Output Dimensionality:** 768 dimensions
- **Similarity Function:** Cosine Similarity
<!-- - **Training Dataset:** Unknown -->
<!-- - **Language:** Unknown -->
<!-- - **License:** Unknown -->

### Model Sources

- **Documentation:** [Sentence Transformers Documentation](https://sbert.net)
- **Repository:** [Sentence Transformers on GitHub](https://github.com/huggingface/sentence-transformers)
- **Hugging Face:** [Sentence Transformers on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/models?library=sentence-transformers)

### Full Model Architecture

```
SentenceTransformer(
  (0): Transformer({'max_seq_length': 384, 'do_lower_case': False, 'architecture': 'MPNetModel'})
  (1): Pooling({'word_embedding_dimension': 768, 'pooling_mode_cls_token': False, 'pooling_mode_mean_tokens': True, 'pooling_mode_max_tokens': False, 'pooling_mode_mean_sqrt_len_tokens': False, 'pooling_mode_weightedmean_tokens': False, 'pooling_mode_lasttoken': False, 'include_prompt': True})
  (2): Normalize()
)
```

## Usage

### Direct Usage (Sentence Transformers)

First install the Sentence Transformers library:

```bash
pip install -U sentence-transformers
```

Then you can load this model and run inference.
```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

# Download from the 🤗 Hub
model = SentenceTransformer("sentence_transformers_model_id")
# Run inference
sentences = [
    "Integration failure: CRM (D365, SalesForce, Genesis, PCube, HussMann Services) → SD - Sales and Distribution; certificate error. I noticed that Integration failure: CRM (D365, SalesForce, Genesis, PCube, HussMann Services) → SD - Sales and Distribution; certificate error, and it seems to be causing unexpected behavior. I'm logging this so it can be reviewed and corrected. (Context: [crm (d365, salesforce, genesis, pcube, hussmann services) | sd - sales and distribution] [server | program bug] Group: capg l2 sd brs.)",
    "Request: Adjust Server/Program bug configuration in Mulesoft/EAI. I noticed that Request: Adjust Server/Program bug configuration in Mulesoft/EAI, and it seems to be causing unexpected behavior.

]
embeddings = model.encode(sentences)
print(embeddings.shape)
# [3, 768]

# Get the similarity scores for the embeddings
similarities = model.similarity(embeddings, embeddings)
print(similarities)
# tensor([[1.0000, 0.0436, 0.0546],
#         [0.0436, 1.0000, 0.2757],
#         [0.0546, 0.2757, 1.0000]])
